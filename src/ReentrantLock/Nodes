ReentrantLock is java is a lock that allows the thread that hols the lock to re-enter or reacquire the same lock with out
blocking . This is useful when a thread need to lock multiple times in the same execution flow.



Explanation:
Reentrant Lock Behavior:

In the increment method, the lock is acquired using lock.lock().
Inside increment, the method nestedIncrement is called, which also acquires the same lock.
Since the same thread is re-entering the lock, it succeeds in reacquiring it.
Thread Safety:

The ReentrantLock ensures only one thread can modify the counter at a time.
